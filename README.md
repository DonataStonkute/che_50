Cognitive Health Expectancy at Age 50

Code for the paper "Educational and gender gaps in cognitive health expectancy across Europe: A prevalence-based analysis using SHARE" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827323001350
](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118886)
In this paper, I replicate my previous approach that combines the Sullivan method and multivariate life tables to calculate CHE using SHARE data. The code provided is for replicating the main analysis. If you are interested in replicating the senstivitiy analysis, feel free to reach out.

This analysis uses data or information from the Harmonized Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe dataset and Codebook, Version F as of February 2023 developed by the Gateway to Global Aging Data. You can access the data here: https://g2aging.org/downloads.
